## Multivariate recurrent GANs for generating biomedical time-series

### Overview

This project is focused on developing a recurrent GAN architecture that can imitate and generate real-time biomedical time series.

In terms of methodologies, we are inspired by the RGAN and RCGAN (conditional RGAN) architecture proposed by [Esteban, Hyland and Rätsch 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02633). We aim to modify and further develop existing frameworks. The end goal of this project is to generate realistic biomedical time series which could enrich/mix salient medical features.

In terms of biomedical data, we aim to work with the existing MIMIC-III benchmarks which are documented in [Harutyunyan, Khachatrian, Kale, Ver Steeg and Galstyan 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771). The MIMIC-III benchmark workflows can be found in the following public GitHub [repository](https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks).

### Dependencies

This repository's source code was tested with python versions `3.7.*` and R versions `3.6.*`.

1. Install python dependencies located in `requirements.txt`:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install R-based dependencies used in `gg.R`:

```R
> install.packages(c("ggplot2","tools","extrafont","reshape2","optparse","plyr"))
```

3. Optional: Install [binary](https://github.com/nwtgck/gif-progress) for adding progress bar to produced gif's.

### Workflow

Our workflow and source code can be found in the `src` directory of this repository. Additionally, the [readme](/src/README.md) in the `src` directory documents our functions, scripts and results.

A thorough development log for our ideas/progress can be found [here](/docs/todos.md).
